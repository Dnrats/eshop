# eshop
# Description
There's nothing much to say about this project. It is based on the 3h tutorial that i found on youtube. At some point i told myself that maybe i need to refresh my memory about WordPress and learn something new. So i decided to find and interesting project to do. This is the result of it. This is the first part of my 3 part refreshining memory journey through CMS. The next 2 will be PrestaShop and Drupal. 
Here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg2gTkifC-Y) to the tutorial.
# Tools used
This e-commerce website is built using only WordPress, Elementor and WooCommerce. And bunch of plugins for forms and stuff, which are not really improtant.
# Features
It's a small version of an eshop where you can buy things. I didn't integrate a payment system to avoid weird situations and also because i needed to create a business PayPal account. Same goes for stripe payments. 
# Documentation
